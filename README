This repository contains some rather old files from my experiments with fhem.

I used some existing I2C device driver files to create drivers for the displays EA DOGM204 and CBerry28,
the pressure sensor HP03S and the temperature/humidity sensor HYT321.
The drivers for the CBerry28 are based on the C code examples provided by the manufacturer.

I also fixed some bugs in or enhanced existing drivers I used in my experiments (eg. MCP342x, SHT21, TLS2561).


Feel free to use these files for your own experiments.
